{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Only this block supports artifacts for now.
{% endhint %}

This block supports two types of artifacts : JSON (.json) and Executable Code (.js).

**JSON** :  will be added to the “artifacts” variable which is array in specific order (for example artifacts\[0] is e\_grid\_mapping json object).

**Executable Code** :  will be executed before main function.
