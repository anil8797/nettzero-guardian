**Note:**

1. Only fields of ‘Hedera Account’ type can be used for ‘accountId’.
2. If the field specified in the ‘accountId’ is not found in the current document then the system will look for it in the parent documents.
3. ‘Associate’ and ‘Dissociate’ actions are not available when ‘Account Type’ is set to ‘Custom’. For these operations ‘[**tokenConfirmationBlock**](tokenconfirmationblock.md)’ should be used instead.

| Dissociate  | Removes the aforementioned ‘link’.                                                                                                                             |
