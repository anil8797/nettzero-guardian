{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:**

1. Account field type need to be referred in â€˜tokenConfirmationBlockâ€™ and â€˜tokenActionBlockâ€™. They can be present both in the parent and child documents.
2. If there are multiple fields of the â€˜Accountâ€™ with the same name, then the value from the most immediate scope, i.e. from the current (â€˜childâ€™) document is used.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note: Important points to be noted when "Enum" type is selected:**

1. Enum values can be added by editing or by importing it from link or from file.
2. If we are importing files by URL. The response should be ({"enum": \["Option1", "Option2", "Option3"]}) or has same format such as importing file (Options separated by new line symbol).

Example of URL which has correct format: [https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreihgbx6fsqup4psfbzjcf57zjdbfwisbjbsqzvwlg4hgx5s5xyqwzm](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreihgbx6fsqup4psfbzjcf57zjdbfwisbjbsqzvwlg4hgx5s5xyqwzm)

3\. If we put more than five options, it will be automatically loaded to IPFS.
{% endhint %}
